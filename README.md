# Coronavirus twitter analysis

All geotagged tweets sent in 2020 were scanned to monitor for the spread of the coronavirus on social media. The data can be found in the viz folder and the corresponding hashtags within those folders correspond to the number of times that hashtag has been used. This helps us to visualize how the spread of the covid 19 virus impacted each country and each language spoken in each location differently.
